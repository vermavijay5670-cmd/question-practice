    question: 'How many of the following statements about the Biot-Savart law are correct?\n1. It is used to calculate the magnetic field due to a current element.\n2. The field is proportional to sinθ, where θ is the angle between the current element and the position vector.\n3. The field decreases as the square of the distance from the current element.\n4. It gives a field parallel to the current element\'s direction.',

The field inside an ideal solenoid is uniform.\n3. The field inside a toroid is completely uniform throughout its core, independent of radial position.\n4.
