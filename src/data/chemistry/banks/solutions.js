      'helium increases the density of the breathing mixture'
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'At high underwater pressure, nitrogen dissolves in blood in large amounts due to Henry\'s law; on rapid ascent it forms bubbles causing decompression sickness (bends). Helium, being less soluble in blood, is used instead of nitrogen to avoid this.',

    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Positive deviation occurs when solute-solvent (A-B) interactions are weaker than the solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions, so molecules escape into vapour more easily than predicted, raising the vapour pressure above the ideal value.',

    options: ['zero', 'positive (endothermic)', 'negative (exothermic)', 'undefined'],
