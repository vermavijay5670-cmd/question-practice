    question: 'How many of the following statements about connecting two charged capacitors together are correct?\n1. Total charge is conserved during the process.\n2. Total energy is always conserved (no loss) during the process.\n3. Common potential reached is a charge-weighted average involving the individual capacitances.\n4. Some energy is generally lost as heat due to resistance in the connecting wires.',
    options: ['One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four'],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Statement 2 is false — total energy is generally NOT conserved; some is lost as heat during the redistribution process, contradicting statement 2 while confirming statement 4.',
    difficulty: 'hard'

    question: 'How many of the following statements about the electric potential energy of a dipole and related quantities are correct?\n1. U = -pE cosθ describes the potential energy of a dipole in a uniform field.\n2. The dipole is in stable equilibrium at θ = 0°.\n3. The dipole is in unstable equilibrium at θ = 90°.\n4. The work done in rotating a dipole from θ1 to θ2 in a uniform field equals the change in its potential energy.',
    options: ['One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four'],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Statement 3 is false — θ = 90° is not an equilibrium position at all (torque is non-zero, in fact maximum, there); unstable equilibrium actually occurs at θ = 180°, not θ = 90°.',
