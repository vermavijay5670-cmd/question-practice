    question: 'Enthalpy of formation of H2O(l) is -286 kJ/mol. Heat released on formation of 36g of water is:',
    options: ['286 kJ', '572 kJ', '143 kJ', '100 kJ'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: '36g of water is 2 moles. Total heat = 2 * 286 = 572 kJ [84].',

    question: 'At high temperature, which term dominates in the Gibbs equation?',
    options: ['ΔH', 'TΔS', 'ΔU', 'PΔV'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'As T increases, the TΔS term becomes more significant in ΔG = ΔH - TΔS [46].',
