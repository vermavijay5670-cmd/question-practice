      'charge can take any continuous value',
      'charge is created and destroyed freely'
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Quantization of charge means the total charge on any body is always an integral multiple of the elementary charge e (q = ne, n an integer), never a fractional value.',

    id: 'charges-fields-2',
    type: 'mcq',
    question: 'At the macroscopic level, we usually ignore quantization of charge and treat it as continuous because',
    options: [
      'quantization does not actually exist',

      'charge is not actually quantized in conductors',
      'quantization applies only to insulators'
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Since e ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C is minuscule compared to charges we usually deal with (of order microcoulombs and higher), the granularity is undetectable and charge can be treated as a continuous variable.',

    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'At any point in space, the electric field has a single, unique direction (the resultant of contributions from all charges). If two field lines crossed, the field at the intersection would have two directions simultaneously, contradicting the definition of a field.',

    question: 'How many of the following statements about the electric field between two large, oppositely charged, closely-spaced parallel plates (a parallel plate capacitor) are correct?\n1. The field between the plates, away from the edges, is approximately uniform.\n2. The field magnitude equals σ/ε₀, where σ is the surface charge density on each plate.\n3. The field lines are curved rather than straight in the central region between the plates.\n4. The field is zero outside the region between the two plates, in the idealized case (ignoring edge effects).',

    question: 'How many of the following statements about charge quantization and conservation are correct?\n1. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n2. All observed free charges are integral multiples of e.\n3. In a closed system, charge can appear or disappear without any corresponding transfer, as long as the total remains balanced.\n4. Charge conservation has been verified in numerous physical and chemical processes without exception.',

    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Statement 3 is false — charge conservation means charge is neither created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred between parts of a system, not simply "appear or disappear" even if balanced overall in some ill-defined way.',

It is conventionally taken to be positive.\n3. Using a very large test charge gives a more accurate measurement of the field.\n4. The field measured is defined as the limiting value of force per unit charge as the test charge tends to zero.',
